***Translations & Internationalisation**

*Default language*

edit config/initializers/locale.rb

edit the line:

I18n.default_locale = :en

(for example for Indonesian:
I18n.default_locale = :id
)

* Restrict available languages *

By default the system will look in config/locales and based on the languages there, it will populate the available langauges array

You can override this by editing the line in config/initializers/locale.rb

I18n.available_locales = [:en]

For example, to specify that the site should only run in Indonesian,  and French but not English:

I18n.available_locales = [:id, :fr]

** Add new language **

To add a new language you need to translate Rails, add model translations and add template string translations.
There is also full page translations

* Page translations *

See home/index.en.html.erb and home/index.id.html.erb for different ones

*  Rails translations **

This file contains all the translations that rails holds internally for example the messages given when validations fail

Download the appropriate rails internationalisation file from https://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n/tree/master/rails/locale/ and put in
config/locales

Rename to id.rails.yml for example

config/locales/id.yml

* Model translations *

id:
  activerecord:
      models:

* Template / View translations *

in config/locales/id.yml

layouts:
      application:
        title:  "HOT Separate OSM Data Store"
